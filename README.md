# Note Travel
Note Travel is an iOS app designed to easily keep track of places around the world and recreate the travel experience. This app was built as my final project for the Udacity's iOS bootcamp. [Note Travel in AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/note-travel/id1107345692). 

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/duris/Note-Travel`

## Usage
<!-- Welcome to Note Travel! -->
To start using Note Travel simply tap the "Add New Entry" button.
Search for a city you've traveled to or are currently in and select it.

<!-- Finding a New Place -->
Find a place to rate (restaurant, venue, etc.) by tapping on the "Find places" button below the map.
As you search places will populate the search results. You can search for categories like "coffee, bars", or business names like "starbucks". Tap a place in the list to show it on the map or tap the search button to see the map results as well. When you find a place to rate select the annotation callout accessory. Give the place you found a rating using the slider and tap save.

<!-- Editing Items -->
There are edit buttons throughout the app to assist in editing and deleting items.

<!-- Change Place Photo -->
Tapping on the photo while viewing a place will randomly select a new image.

<!-- Refresh Entry Photos -->
Hitting the refresh button on the Entry table page will select a random photo from its photos that have been
downloaded with the places. Only photos with places with a rating above 6 will be shown on the Entry table page.

<!-- Viewing an Entry -->
Selecting a table row while viewing an entry will zoom into the place on the map and select it. Tapping the 
annotation callout accessory will take you the rating page and display the rating you chose previously.
